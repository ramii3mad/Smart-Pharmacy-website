# Smart Pharmacy website
Through this site, the patient can identify the medication written in the medical prescription by photographing the prescription. The site will carry out some operations and return to you the names of the drugs written in the medical prescription written in the doctorâ€™s handwriting that we are having difficulty reading. These stages include removing the header and the footer for the prescription to enter the model to be completed. Predicting written drags, but I worked on 7 drug only, and we hope in the future that someone will adopt this idea so that we can develop it more
